# Resource Crops
> **Project Type:** Personal project  
> **Project Description:** Minecraft mod which allows player to grow & harvest their resources
> **Project Goal:** Publish quality mod based on Magical Crops / Mystical Agriculture  
> **Languages & Technologies:** Java, 3D Modeling  

## Idea
Remake Magical Crops / Mystical Agriculture (MC/MA), but better! Basically, take the core of the mod, but make the content deeper and more fulfilling... it should be more difficult and less tedious. 

#### Potential Names
- Flora Essentia
- Essentia Botanica
- Mythic Botany 
- Geobotany

## Mods
- **Main** - Main mod, handle crops and stuff
- **Integration Handler** - Handle integration with other mods (add ability to create custom crops via json)
	- Include integration with Sean's Agricraft remake
- **Armory** - Like MC/MA Armory, but better

## Changes
What is changing from MC/MA in my remake (If its not mentioned, assume it will be the same or have only minor tweaks)

#### Main Mod
- New core essence names
	- Something magical sounding, more similar to Magical Crops
- New way to upgrade essence
	- Not basic infusion stone...
	- Still need ideas
- Rework of growth pulsers
	- Replace them with a different method of speeding up crop growth
	- Similar to the Lilypad of Fertility (from Reliquary) perhaps
- New way to obtain essence seeds
	- Not simply seed level + some of the resource
	- Infusion process?
		- Machinery???

#### Integration Handler
- Include integration handling for Sean's Agricraft remake

#### Armory
- Complete re-design: scrap everything and make new items and armory system
	- Keep system similar to augments & alter crafting
